## About the Project
Gachasphere was built with the intention of being a central hub for all things mobile gameing. Due to the free-to-play nature of Gacha games, most players are actively playing multiple games at the same time. Unfortunately, the communities for each individual game remain isolated. Gachasphere hopes to be a bridge that connect those communities together.

## Usage
To start, you will want to register a an new account or log into an existing account. Once you're in, you will be able to see the global user rankings for all the top games. From there, you can create your own list of games that you have played and give each game a Gameplay rating and a Free-To-Play rating. Each game has it's own dedicated page where you can see more details including popular reddit threads and twitter posts from the game's offical account.
