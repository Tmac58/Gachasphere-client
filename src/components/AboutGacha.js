        <p className="about-text">Gacha games are mobile video games based on the gashapon model (capsule toy dispensing vending machines). The games are free-to-play, and 
            players can "pull or "spin" the gacha (characters, cards, or other items) like you would a slot machine. Players are offered the opportunity 
            to buy gacha as an incentive to spend real-world money or use in game currency acquired by playing the game. This type of game became widely
            popular in the early 2010s, especially in Japan.</p>
